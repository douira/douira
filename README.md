### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I very recently completed my Master's of Computer Science at the [University of LÃ¼beck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/universitaet/universitaet.html) and am now looking for a job. Let me know if you have something exciting! I'm interested in algorithm development, complexity theory, generative art, game technology, and interface design. Other interests of mine include gaming, baking cakes, and gardening.

Some of my work:

- Extensive work in [two](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/pull/2016) [PRs](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/pull/2352) of adding translucency sorting to [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric) as part of my Master's thesis on this topic.
- The Resolution Editor is a document management and editing software for use at MUN conferences like [MUNOL](https://munol.org/).
- [glsl-transformer](https://github.com/IrisShaders/glsl-transformer): A GLSL program transformation Java library based on ANTLR 4, used in [Iris](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/).
