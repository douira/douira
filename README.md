### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I very recently completed my Master's of Computer Science at the [University of LÃ¼beck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/universitaet/universitaet.html) and am now looking for a job. Let me know if you have something exciting! I'm interested in algorithm development, complexity theory, generative art, game technology, and interface design.

## My Projects

- My Master's thesis: **Implementation and Analysis of Geometric Algorithms for
Translucency Sorting in Minecraft**. You can download the thesis text and accompanying presentation [here](https://douira.dev/).\
These two PRs [#2016](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/pull/2016) [#2352](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/pull/2352) are the implementation of translucency sorting in [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric).
- The Resolution Editor is a document management and editing software for use at MUN conferences like [MUNOL](https://munol.org/).
- [glsl-transformer](https://github.com/IrisShaders/glsl-transformer): A GLSL program transformation Java library based on ANTLR 4, used in [Iris](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/).
