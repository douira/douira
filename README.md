### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm a student at the [University of LÃ¼beck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/universitaet/universitaet.html) doing my Master's of Computer Science currently. I'm interested in creating well-designed and helpful things with aesthetic qualities. Other interests of mine include gaming, baking cakes and gardening. My interesting projects are pinned in my profile but here's also a list of some:

- The Resolution Editor is a document management and editing software for use at MUN conferences like [MUNOL](https://munol.org/).
- [glsl-transformer](https://github.com/IrisShaders/glsl-transformer): A GLSL code transformation Java library based on ANTLR 4.

I'd like to learn Haskell at some point.
